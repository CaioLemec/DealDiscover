#  Go to https://oxylabs.io/ in your web browser.

# Create an account on the Oxylabs website. You might need to provide some basic information and follow the registration process.

# After creating your account, navigate to the dashboard or wherever you can manage your APIs.

# Create a new API. This process may involve specifying the type of data you want to access or other configurations depending on Oxylabs' interface.

# Once the API is created, locate the username and password associated with it. These credentials will be used to authenticate your requests to the Oxylabs API.

# Rename the file where your code is located to .env.local. This file is often used to store environment variables.

# Open the .env.local file and add the following content, replacing "api_username" and "api_password" with the actual username and password you obtained from the Oxylabs API:

VITE_OXYLABS_API_USERNAME="api_username"
VITE_OXYLABS_API_PASSWORD="api_password"

# This sets up environment variables in your project, and you can access them in your code using the process.env.VITE_OXYLABS_API_USERNAME and process.env.VITE_OXYLABS_API_PASSWORD expressions.
